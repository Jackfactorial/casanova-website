<h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    I cannot imagine my life without music. Since I was five years old, I wanted to play the violin.  
    I lived in a small town in North Dakota that did not have a string program (the Suzuki method was 
    only in Japan at that time).  At age 5, I started piano lessons and at 10 my family moved to the 
    capitol of North Dakota and I was able to start the violin in an excellent public-school program.  
    My early training was “traditional”, which was before the advent of the Suzuki Method.  After 
    college I discovered the benefits of the Suzuki Method and became a certified Suzuki Instructor, 
    books 1-10.

    Numerous studies show that students that study music, test higher on standardized tests, are more 
    successful in school, and are generally more well-rounded individuals. Not everyone will have a career 
    in music, but we all can become educated in music and experience the joy of music in our lives.

    I have taught violin to all ages and levels.  When starting young students (ages 4 through school age), 
    I prefer the Suzuki method because of the benefits of early success (see “The Suzuki Method” section). 
    I have students that are new beginners and students with previous experience that need additional training.

    It is important for each of my students to have an individualized curriculum and I support them in their 
    personal music goals. Lessons can include any music a student plays in public, such as auditions, chair 
    tryouts, and orchestra music.  It is important that my students have a nurturing and positive environment 
    at their lessons. I have taught many students over multiple years and the result is a special student/instructor 
    relationship.

  <p>
    Music feeds my soul and I look forward to sharing with you my passion for violin.
