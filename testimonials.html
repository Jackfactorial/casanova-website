        "I studied with Mrs. Casanova from when I was 9 though my sophomore year in high school. 
        She was and still is one of the best mentors I have ever had. She is a wonderful, 
        experienced teacher who takes the time to teach students how to play the violin well 
        and she makes lessons very engaging and fun. Mrs. Casanova helped me achieve goals like 
        All State Orchestra and concertmaster positions and has guided me on the path to becoming 
        a music major in college. I would not be where I am now with violin and I am extremely 
        grateful for her in my life.by designers. It's easy on the eyes and a great go to font 
        for titles, paragraphs & more."

        "I studied with Barb from 1st-8th grades. She not only provided valuable violin guidance 
        but was also a great role model for me. Her upbeat, friendly demeanor was one reason I fell 
        in love with playing and improving. With the great foundation she provided me, I went on to 
        be concertmaster of the DYAO, first prize winner of the Greeley Phil concerto competition, 
        as well as earning a Masters degree, with a full ride scholarship, in Violin Performance 
        from Boston University. I went on to perform full time, winning positions with professional 
        orchestras such as the New World Symphony under Michael Tilson Thomas, the New Mexico Symphony 
        and the Louisiana Philharmonic. I would highly recommend Barb as a teacher!"

        "I first picked up the violin at the age of 30.  Barb was excited to take on an adult beginning 
        student, and I am so grateful for that because it is not a challenge that every teacher would be 
        up for! Four years later, Barb is committed as ever to making me a better player.  Barb knows my 
        weaknesses and pushes me to do the 'not so fun parts' of practicing, like metronome work and 
        rhythms, because she knows it will ultimately make me a better musician. She is diligent about 
        taking notes during lessons, so we are clear on what I need to work on to keep pushing forward.  
        Barb also doesn't shy away from recognizing her students' strengths.    She will not hesitate to 
        mention if I have 'pretty sound' in a certain section, or 'give her the chills' with my vibrato.  
        It is always motivating to get some positive reinforcement, and Barb does a great job of that.  
        As an adult student, she recognizes that my violin career is different from her other students.  
        She caters to my unique playing goals, but still suggests interesting pieces and orchestras fit 
        for my abilities.  She has truly become a close friend, and I feel so lucky to have her as a mentor."

        "I was a student of Mrs. Casanova’s for five years (4th grade-8th grade) in school orchestra. Without 
        her I would not be up to the caliber that I am. I would not be able to play and understand complicated 
        pieces of music and because of her I have been able to play more challenging pieces even when they were 
        probably too hard for me. When I was a violinist in her orchestra we were able to go to CMEA twice and 
        she made it possible for 24 people in her orchestra to make it in Jeffco’s All County Honor Orchestra. 
        This is 3 times more than any other school was able to get in. This is because Mrs. Casanova guided us 
        through the audition piece and helped us perfect it.  She is the best teacher I have ever had.  She helped 
        me improve so much throughout the five years I was in her orchestra. If you want to improve, then she is 
        the teacher for you."
